## Project description

Pi in the Sky is a fully functional RC plane built from scratch. It consists of two flight modes: manual and stabalized.
Manual mode allows for low-latency, long-range (up to 20 km) flight, while stabalized mode enables PID-based stabalization
controls. We categorize the various components of our project into two distinct systems: the ground unit and air unit.

_Ground Unit_ üïπÔ∏è

Our transmitter contains code to read joystick and button values and transmit control information to the air unit. We use an
MCP3008 ADC to read analog joystick values and transmit them to the ground Pi over a SPI bus. We developed a synchronizing UART
based protocol to reliably transmit information to the air unit. The transmitter also emits heartbeat pulses to ensure connectivity with
the air unit.

_Air Unit_ üéà

The air unit receives control commands from the ground unit using UART interrupts (implemented using GPIO interrupts on the RX pin).
Servo commands are relayed to the PCA9685 PWM servo control board over I2C. The manual and PID control systems are defined and
tuned. Additionally, a fail-safe system is written to shut off controls if heartbeat pulses are not received from transmitter. We
use SPI and I2C protocols to read fused euler angles from a BNO055 IMU by first routing the data through an Arduino Nano. These
values are used to as inputs to the PID loop.
